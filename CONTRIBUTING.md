# Contributing

[TOC]

Thank you for your interest in helping Magrathea grow! There are lots of ways you can help. First, a quick glossary for those new to GitHub:

-   _"Repo"_ is short for repository, as in a [GitHub Repository]().
-   _"PR"_ is short for [Pull Request]().
-   _"Issue"_ refers to a [GitHub Issue](), GitHub's method for opening tickets.
-   _"Discussion"_ refers to a [GitHub Discussion]().

Generally speaking, we use Discussions to brainstorm and workshop things, and Issues to keep track of actionable tasks. 

The following are the general guidelines for contributing to Magrathea. Specific projects may have different guidelines, and, where this is the case, an overriding `CONTRIBUTING.md` document will be found in said projectâ€™s repo. 

## Report Bugs

If you've run into a problem with any Magrathea project, please let us know! We'd especially love to hear about bugs relating to [accessibility]() or [approachability](). Bugs can reported as GitHub Issues. Please be sure to double check for an already existing Issue covering the same problem before opening a new one.

**If an Issue already exists for the bug you want to report,** please react to the Issue's description with a :thumbsup: to add a +1 to that bug, so we can better understand how many people are impacted by it. Please only add a new comment to the Issue if you have new information to add that is not already part of the conversation.

**If you've found a problem with a particular project,** please open an Issue in that project's GitHub repo.

**If you've found a problem with the Magrathea site,** please open an Issue in the `rp-magrathea/rp-magrathea.github.io` repo.

**If you'd like to fix a bug yourself,** please feel free to open a PR against the corresponding repo. All PRs are reviewed for quality and consistency. While we greatly appreciate your interest in helping, please know that you may be asked to make some revisions before your PR can be merged.

## Suggest an Idea

We'd love to hear about your ideas for helping Magrathea grow. Some ideas may not be right for Magrathea at the time, and we may not have the capacity to take on even the best of suggestions, but your input helps us understand and properly prioritize which directions to head in.

Ideas can be provided as GitHub Discussions. **If a Discussion has already been started for your idea,** please react to the Discussion's description with a :thumbsup: to add a +1 to that idea, so we can better understand how many people are interested. Please only add a new comment to the Discussion if you have new information (or a new question!) to add that is not already part of the conversation.

**If you have a new idea for an existing project,** please start a new Discussion in that project's GitHub repo. 

**If you have a new idea for a new project,** please start a new Discussion in the `rp-magrathea/rp-magrathea.github.io` repo.

**If you have a new idea for the Magrathea site,** please start a new Discussion in the `rp-magrathea/rp-magrathea.github.io` repo.

**If you have an idea for the Magrathea Discord server,** please start a new Discussion in the `rp-magrathea/rp-magrathea.github.io` repo.

For all other ideas, please start a new Discussion in the `rp-magrathea/rp-magrathea.github.io` repo.

**If you'd like to add a new feature to a project yourself,** please feel free to open a PR against the corresponding repo. All PRs are reviewed for quality and consistency. While we greatly appreciate your interest in helping, please know that you may be asked to make some revisions before your PR can be merged.

## Ask a Question

We want to help as best we can, and that includes answering whatever questions you may have about Magrathea and its constituent projects. Please be patient if we don't get back to you right away; we'll respond when we can.

**Members of the community are encouraged to answer questions if and only if they also provide a link to their answer's source.** The goal is not to just hand folks fish, but to help teach them _how_ to fish.

Questions can be asked as GitHub Discussions. **If a Discussion has already been started relating to your question,** please react to the Discussion's description with a :thumbsup: to add a +1, so we can better understand how many people are interested in finding an answer to that question. Please only add a new comment to the Discussion if you have new information to add that is not already part of the conversation.

**If you have a new question about an existing project,** please start a new Discussion in that project's GitHub repo. 

**If you have a new question about the Magrathea site or its contents,** please start a new Discussion in the `rp-magrathea/rp-magrathea.github.io` repo.

**If you have a new question about the Magrathea Discord server,** please start a new Discussion in the `rp-magrathea/rp-magrathea.github.io` repo.

For all other types of questions, you can start a new Discussion in the `rp-magrathea/rp-magrathea.github.io` repo.

## Join the Crew

We're happy to bring more folks on board, of any discipline. You don't have to write code. (In fact, Daine would, for example, love to team up with somebody who _doesn't_ want to code, because they'd rather focus on theme design.) Maybe you want to help with project management or Discord moderation. Maybe you're interested in porting themes to different hosts. Maybe you just love creating supplementary assets for RPGs. Or maybe you have some other way you want to help that we haven't even dreamed up yet. If you have something you'd like to offer, to help Magrathea grow and better support our unique community, we'd love to hear about it.

You also need not be an expert to be part of the crew. We're happy to take on folks of any skill level because, for all our crew, it's far more important that you are willing to learn, receptive to constructive critique, and eager not just to make things work, but to understand _how_ and _why_ things work, and the impact they'll have.

Anyone interested in joining Magrathea's crew should reach out directly to the captain of this ship, [Daine](https://daine.dev). When you do, please be sure to include the following info:

-   Your alias, pronouns, and time zone (so we can be sure to address you respectfully!)
-   Your areas of interest or expertise
-   Your experience in those areas (if any)
-   How exactly you'd like to help
-   Why you want to help

These topics are meant to help start a conversation, so that we can get a feel for whether you'd be a good fit for the crew. Not everyone will be, and that's okay! There are still plenty of ways you can help. You don't even have to be an official member of the crew to do most of the things mentioned in this guide. Any and all contributions are appreciated.

## Send Encouragement

One of the quickest and easiest ways you can help Magrathea is to send a few words of encouragement or appreciation. You can do this via Discussions in the various Magrathea repos, or whatever other means is most comfortable for you.

## Fund the Effort

While we very much appreciate any interest in sending money to help support Magrathea, we do not as an organization accept funds. The best way to show your appreciation financially is to tip individual crew members. Check the Sponsor section in a repo you care about or ask the crew member directly to find out the best tipping method. 

## Donate a Project

If you have a project that you'd like to donate to Magrathea, first of all, thank you! That's most generous and greatly appreciated. Please know that **we can only accept donations with explicit consent from all parties involved in their creation.**

To kick things off, please add all related code and documentation to a public GitHub repo (if it's not already in one). Your repo **must** include a license, and that license must be open source. Next, open an Issue in the `rp-magrathea/rp-magrathea.github.io` repo to let us know what your project is and where to find its repo. The Magrathea crew will then review your project. 

Your interest in donating a project to Magrathea is always appreciated, but please know that only projects that meet Magrathea's standards for accessibility and approachability will be accepted. We may at this point decline your offer, or we may ask (in the form of opening Issues in your project's repo) for changes to help bring your project up to standard. Your project need not match existing Magrathea projects' code styles and conventions, so long as the styles and conventions in use are clear, well-documented, and consistent.

When your project is ready, we'll ask you to [transfer ownership of the project's repo](https://docs.github.com/github/administering-a-repository/transferring-a-repository) to the `rp-magrathea` GitHub organization. This provides us all with a structured transfer that will maintain records of all contributions and contributors to the project. This will also automatically add you to the repo as a collaborator.
