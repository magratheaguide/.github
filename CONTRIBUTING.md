# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in helping Magrathea grow! There are lots of ways you can help. First, a quick glossary for those new to GitHub:

-   _"Repo"_ is short for repository, as in a [GitHub Repository](https://docs.github.com/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories).
-   _"PR"_ is short for [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
-   _"Issue"_ refers to a [GitHub Issue](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue), GitHub's method for opening tickets.
-   _"Discussion"_ refers to a [GitHub Discussion](https://docs.github.com/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions).

For more help getting started with GitHub, check out [GitHub's own Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).

Generally speaking, here at Magrathea we use Discussions to brainstorm and workshop things, and Issues to keep track of actionable tasks.

The following are the general guidelines for contributing to Magrathea. Specific projects may have different guidelines, and, where this is the case, an overriding `CONTRIBUTING.md` document will be found in said projectâ€™s repo.

## Report Bugs

If you've run into a problem with any Magrathea project, please let us know! We'd especially love to hear about bugs relating to accessibility or approachability. Bugs can reported as GitHub Issues. Please be sure to double check for an already existing Issue covering the same problem before opening a new one.

**If an Issue already exists for the bug you want to report,** please react to the Issue's description with a :thumbsup: to add a +1 to that bug, so we can better understand how many people are impacted by it. Please only add a new comment to the Issue if you have new information to add that is not already part of the conversation.

**If you've found a problem with a particular project,** please open an Issue in that project's GitHub repo.

**If you've found a problem with the Magrathea site,** please open an Issue in the [`rp-magrathea/rp-magrathea.github.io`](https://github.com/rp-magrathea/rp-magrathea.github.io) repo.

**If you'd like to fix a bug yourself,** please feel free to open a PR against the corresponding repo. All PRs are reviewed for quality and consistency. While we greatly appreciate your interest in helping, please know that you may be asked to make some revisions before your PR can be merged.

## Suggest an Idea

We'd love to hear about your ideas for helping Magrathea grow. Some ideas may not be right for Magrathea at the time, and we may not have the capacity to take on even the best of suggestions, but your input helps us understand and properly prioritize which directions to head in.

## Join the Crew

We're happy to bring more folks on board, of any discipline. You don't have to write code. (In fact, Daine would, for example, love to team up with somebody who _doesn't_ want to code because they'd rather focus on theme design.) Maybe you want to help with project management or Discord moderation. Maybe you're interested in porting themes to different hosts. Maybe you just love creating supplementary assets for RPGs. Or maybe you have some other way you want to help that we haven't even dreamed up yet. If you'd like to somehow offer your time and talents to help Magrathea grow and better support our unique community, we'd love to hear about it.

You also need not be an expert to be part of the crew. We're happy to take on folks of any skill level because, for all our crew, it's far more important that you are willing to learn, receptive to constructive critique, and eager not just to make things work, but to understand _how_ and _why_ things work, and the impact they'll have.

Anyone interested in joining Magrathea's crew should reach out directly to the captain of this ship, [Daine](https://daine.dev). When you do, please be sure to include the following info:

-   Your alias, pronouns, and time zone (so we can be sure to address you respectfully!)
-   Your areas of interest or expertise
-   Your experience in those areas (if any)
-   How exactly you'd like to help
-   Why you want to help

These topics are meant to help start a conversation, so that we can get a feel for whether you'd be a good fit for the crew. Not everyone will be, and that's okay! There are still plenty of ways you can help. You don't even have to be an official member of the crew to do most of the things mentioned in this guide.

## Send Encouragement

One of the quickest and easiest ways you can help Magrathea is to send a few words of encouragement or appreciation. You can do this via Discussions in the various Magrathea repos, or whatever other means is most comfortable for you.

## Fund the Effort

While we very much appreciate any interest in sending money to help support Magrathea, we do not as an organization accept funds. The best way to show your appreciation financially is to tip individual crew members. Check the Sponsor section in a repo you care about for info about tipping that project's lead, or ask a crew member directly to find out their best tipping method.
