# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in helping Magrathea grow! There are lots of ways you can help. First, a quick glossary for those new to GitHub:

-   _"Repo"_ is short for repository, as in a [GitHub Repository](https://docs.github.com/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repositories).
-   _"PR"_ is short for [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
-   _"Issue"_ refers to a [GitHub Issue](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue), GitHub's method for opening tickets.
-   _"Discussion"_ refers to a [GitHub Discussion](https://docs.github.com/discussions/collaborating-with-your-community-using-discussions/about-discussions).

For more help getting started with GitHub, check out [GitHub's own Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).

Generally speaking, here at Magrathea we use Discussions to brainstorm and workshop things, and Issues to keep track of actionable tasks.

The following are the general guidelines for contributing to Magrathea. Specific projects may have different guidelines, and, where this is the case, an overriding `CONTRIBUTING.md` document will be found in said projectâ€™s repo.

## Send Encouragement

One of the quickest and easiest ways you can help Magrathea is to send a few words of encouragement or appreciation. You can do this via Discussions in the various Magrathea repos, or whatever other means is most comfortable for you.

## Buy Us a Coffee

While we very much appreciate any interest in sending money to help support Magrathea, we do not as an organization accept funds. The best way to show your appreciation financially is to tip individual crew members. Check the Sponsor section in a repo you care about for info about tipping that project's lead, or ask a crew member directly to find out their best tipping method.
