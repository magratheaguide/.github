# Magrathea Code of Conduct

Like the technical community as a whole, the Magrathea team and community is made up of a mixture of people from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission—including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, crew, contributors, and those seeking help and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended—a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

## Our Standards

-   **Be friendly and patient.**
-   **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
-   **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect others, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
-   **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the Magrathea community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside the Magrathea community.
-   **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of adults, and we conduct ourselves professionally and with maturity. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.
    -   Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
        -   Violent threats or language directed against another person.
        -   Discriminatory jokes and language.
        -   Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
        -   Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
        -   Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
        -   Unwelcome sexual attention.
        -   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
        -   Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
    -   Examples of encouraged behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment includes, but is not limited to:
        -   Using welcoming and inclusive language.
        -   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
        -   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
        -   Focusing on what is best for the community.
        -   Showing empathy towards other community members.
-   **When we disagree, try to understand why.** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and Magrathea is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of Magrathea comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## Our Responsibilities

Magrathea crew, admininistrators in particular, are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Crew have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, messages, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Magrathea. This includes the Discord server, GitHub repositories, and any other means established by the project team which the community uses for communication. It also applies when an individual is representing Magrathea, its projects, or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

If you believe someone is violating Magrathea's code of conduct, we ask that you report it by contacting Daine via Discord at `daine#1078`.

Alternatively, for violations within GitHub, some Magrathea repositories may be configured to accept reports, enabling you to contact that repository's administrators through GitHub itself. (For more information, see [GitHub's documentation on reporting abuse or spam](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/reporting-abuse-or-spam#reporting-an-issue-or-pull-request)).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Magrathea's administrators and crew will make every reasonable effort to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Magrathea crew who do not follow or enforce the code of conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the crew.
